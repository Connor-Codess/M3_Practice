    "Comments": "This response provides a comprehensive analysis of plastic waste production and recycling methods.  It covers linear and logistic regression for waste prediction, detailed models for drop-off and curbside collection, including cost analysis and PAYT programs, and extends the analysis to a national level.  The document is well-organized, clearly written, and uses a variety of sources to support its assumptions and calculations.",  
    "Q1": {  
      "Definition": "Predict the change in plastic production rate over time, as well as the amount of plastic waste in landfills in the year 2023.",  
      "Assumption": \[  
        "We used data collected from the past ten years because the first plastic bottle was introduced in 1975 \[11\], and recycling has only become important recently. In other words, values used before 2000 would not adequately take into account the recycling methods which have now become widespread."  
      \],  
      "Model": \[  
        "Discarded Plastic Waste (thousands of tons) \= 463.27 \* (years since 2000\) \+ 24443.6; R2 \= .803; S \= 801.",  
        "Discarded Plastic Waste (thousands of tons) \= 23733.8 \+ (28014.1 \- 23733.8) / (1 \+ exp((Years since 2000 \- 2.71325) / \-0.752611)). S \= 422."  
      \],  
      "Results": "Based on this model, the amount of unrecycled plastic waste discarded in 2023 will be 463.27 \* 23 \+ 24443.6 \= 35098.81 thousands of tons, or 35.1 million tons.",  
      "Sensitivity Analysis": "Not explicitly performed for Q1, but the comparison of linear and logistic models serves as a form of sensitivity analysis.",  
      "Strength and Weakness": \[  
        "Strength: Considers both linear and logistic models, acknowledging the limitations of each.",  
        "Strength: Provides clear equations and explanations of the models.",  
        "Weakness: The linear model may overpredict future values, while the logistic model may underpredict by assuming a leveling off."

        "The streets of the city are laid out in a grid.",

        "The composition of recyclables in the MSW stream is fixed over the entire planning horizon.",  
        "Each household makes a collective decision on whether or not to recycle because it is convenient for a household to transport all of their recyclables to a drop-off center together.",  
        "The probability of a household's deciding to recycle varies linearly with the household's distance to the nearest drop-off center.",  
        "Recycling households recycle all recyclable waste.",

      "Model": \[  
        "Drop-off Centers: A simulation that randomly simulated the number of households who would recycle when drop-off centers were placed around the city.  Calculated taxicab distance, household maximum distance to a drop-off center, number of recycling households covered by a drop-off center, annual amount recycled, drop-off center cost, revenue generated, and Pay-As-You-Throw revenue.",  
        "Curbside Collection: Calculated the number of trucks needed to service a given city, based on population density. Calculated the costs of a curbside collection program based on labor, upkeep, and fuel. Determined net revenue generated by these products."

      "Results": \[  
        "Drop-off: Fargo and Wichita generate profits, Price incurs costs.",  
        "Curbside: Fargo and Price incur costs, Wichita generates profits.",  
        "PAYT: Can generate additional revenue for all cities, particularly useful for offsetting costs in Price."  
      \],  
      "Sensitivity Analysis": "Tested the sensitivity of the drop-off center simulation by changing population and area by \+/- 2%, 5%, and 10% and examined the resulting change in annual amount recycled.  Found that the annual amount recycled responds approximately linearly to both area and population.",  
      "Strength and Weakness": \[  
        "Strength: Detailed and comprehensive models for both drop-off and curbside collection.",  
        "Strength: Considers various factors such as distance, population density, cost of operation, and revenue generation.",  
        "Strength: Includes a Pay-As-You-Throw analysis.",  
        "Strength: Uses real-world data and formulas.",  
        "Weakness: Relies on several assumptions, such as uniform population density and consistent recycling behavior.",
