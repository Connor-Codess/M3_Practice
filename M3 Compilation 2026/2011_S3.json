    "Comments": "This solution models the Lake Powell-Lake Mead system, focusing on inflow, outflow, and the impact on water supply and the economy. It considers factors like evaporation, seepage, and power generation at Hoover Dam. The solution also analyzes the sensitivity of the model to changes in inflow rates and proposes policy changes and conservation efforts.",  
    "Q1": {  
      "Definition": "Model the water volume of Lake Powell over a five-year period based on given inflow rates and model the effect that changes of the inflow rate have on areas of interest downstream from the lake.",  
      "Assumption": \[  
        "Over a five-year interval, the inflow rate into Lake Powell will remain fixed at the given value.",  
        "Over a five-year interval, changes in the weather will not significantly affect the evaporation rates of Lakes Mead and Powell and will not affect other sources of inflow into Lake Mead."

      "Model": \[  
        "Lake Powell:  Pvol(n \+ 1\) \= inP(n) \+ P(n) − evapP \* P(n) − outP(n)",  
        "Lake Mead: M(n \+ 1\) \= inM(n) \+ M(n) − evapM \* M(n) − outM(n)",  
        "Outflow of Lake Powell is modeled as a piecewise function based on historical data, with two regions: a constant outflow region and a region where outflow increases linearly with volume.",  
        "Inflow to Lake Mead is modeled as a proportion of Lake Powell outflow plus a constant representing other sources."

      "Sensitivity Analysis": "Examined the sensitivity of the model to changes in inflow rates (1% increments). Found that changes in inflow to Lake Powell have a nearly equal impact on Lake Powell volume, but a smaller impact on Hoover Dam power generation.",
