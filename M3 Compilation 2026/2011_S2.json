    "Comments": "This solution models Lake Powell's water volume, analyzes the impact on water supply and economy, and proposes water conservation strategies. It considers inflow, outflow, evaporation, and bank seepage. The solution also examines the effects on hydroelectric power generation and agricultural output. The response is well-organized and provides a clear methodology.",  
    "Q1": {  
      "Definition": "To model the changes in volume of water in Lake Powell over the next five years, while assuming that outflows of water remain at current levels.",  
      "Assumption": \[  
        "The output amount of water from Lake Powell will remain constant at 8.23 million acre-feet (MAF) per year.",  
        "The bank seepage rate will remain relatively constant at about 458 thousand acre-feet per year.",  
        "The amount of precipitation is assumed to be negligible.",  
        "The average annual water temperature of Lake Powell will remain relatively constant over the next five years, so this will not impact evaporation rates.",  
        "The amount and impact of snow is negligible; we assume that it is included in the inflow rate."

      "Model": "dV/dt \= Inflow \+ Precip \- (Evap(V) \+ BankSeep \+ Outflow) \* t, where V(t) is the volume of water, Inflow is the inflow from the Colorado River, Precip is precipitation, Evap(V) is evaporation (a function of volume), BankSeep is bank seepage, and Outflow is the water released downstream. Evap(V) \= 0.00002531x \+ 48.33386921, where x is volume in acre-feet.  The model was then refined to account for minimum and maximum capacity constraints.",  
      "Results": \[  
        "Low inflow (39%): Lake would run dry.",  
        "Likely inflow (83%): Lake would gradually fill to 81.0% capacity.",  
        "High inflow (137%): Lake would reach 95% capacity and outflow would need to be increased."
