    "Comments": "This solution addresses both plastic waste prediction and optimal recycling program selection. It uses linear regression and a landfill density function to estimate plastic volume in landfills. For recycling programs, it considers participation rates based on socioeconomic factors and calculates costs for different program types (drop-off, curbside, single-stream, pre-sorted). The response is well-organized, detailed, and uses a variety of data sources.",  
    "Q1": {  
      "Definition": "Extrapolated to predict the amount of plastic that will be festering in landfills at the end of the next decade.",  
      "Assumption": \[  
        "Economic conditions will remain relatively stable for the next ten years.",  
        "Calculations began at 1960.",  
        "Linear growth of plastic waste.",  
        "Constant recovery rate (13.5%).",  
        "Combustion rate for total municipal waste has remained constant from 1960 to the present."

      "Model": "Linear regression for waste generation, combined with a non-constant landfill density function (p(d) \= .2485\*d lbs/ft^4+36.05 lbs/ft^3) derived from experimental data.  Calculates total municipal waste and plastic waste sent to landfills, then uses density to estimate volume.",  
      "Results": "The volume of plastic alone in our country's landfills (assuming a uniform depth of 200 ft) will equal about 7.10\*10^9 cubic meters by 2023.",  
      "Sensitivity Analysis": "Not explicitly performed, but the linearity assumption and constant recovery rate are potential sources of error.",  
      "Strength and Weakness": \[  
        "Strength: Uses a non-constant density function, which is more realistic than a simple density calculation.",  
        "Strength: Considers both total municipal waste and plastic waste.",  
        "Strength: Clearly explains the methodology and calculations.",  
        "Weakness: Relies on several assumptions, including constant recovery and combustion rates.",

Then calculates program costs (drop-off, curbside single-stream weekly/biweekly, curbside pre-sorted weekly/biweekly) based on population, participation rate, and cost per ton. Compares costs to a predicted municipal budget for recycling ($6.64 per person).",
