    "Comments": "This solution presents a model for predicting plastic waste and determining the optimal recycling method for different cities. It uses linear regression for waste prediction and considers single-stream, dual-stream, and drop-off recycling. The model includes calculations for costs, budget, and truck fleet conversion. The response is well-structured and provides clear explanations.",

      "Definition": "Predict the amount of discarded plastic which will either be recycled or be placed in landfills.",  
      "Assumption": \[  
        "All plastic waste not recycled goes into a landfill. The amount that reaches other destinations is negligible.",  
        "Plastic production and recycling increase at a linear rate as time passes, based on an extrapolation of the data found."

      "Model": "Linear regression models for plastic generated, recycled, and wasted.  F(x) \= 0.740762066x – 1459.11884 (for plastic waste ending up in landfills).  Integral of this function from 2013 to 2023 is used to estimate total waste.",  
      "Results": "Approximately 357.39 million tons of plastic waste will go to landfills during the years 2013-2023. This would take up 2644.68668 million cubic yards of space.",  
      "Sensitivity Analysis": "Not explicitly performed, but the linearity assumption is acknowledged as a potential source of error.",

        "Weakness: Assumes a linear relationship, which may not be accurate over longer time periods.",
