    "Comments": "This solution presents a comprehensive model for evaluating the feasibility of high-speed rail (HSR) systems, considering ridership, environmental impact, and costs. It uses a detailed ridership model that incorporates commuter behavior, travel time, and cost differences. The cost model includes locomotive and infrastructure costs, with separate calculations for track and station expenses. The solution also analyzes the environmental benefits in terms of reduced diesel fuel consumption. The response is well-organized, clearly written, and provides a thorough analysis.",
