    "Comments": "This comprehensive solution addresses ridership forecasting, cost analysis (initial and variable), energy consumption, and prioritization of high-speed rail (HSR) construction. It uses a multinomial logit model for consumer choice, considers various cost factors, and compares energy consumption with and without HSR. The response is well-organized, detailed, and provides clear justifications for its models and assumptions. The inclusion of sensitivity analysis and a discussion of limitations adds to its strength.",

        "Since there is no clear trend in gasoline prices, the price of gasoline will be assumed constant for the model at this time.",  
        "The population's income increases with inflation. Therefore, the relative disutility (cost) of traveling by train, car, or plane will remain constant for the future. Travel cost will be calculated in current dollars.",
