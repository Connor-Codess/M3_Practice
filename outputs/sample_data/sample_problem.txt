M3 Challenge 2024 - Renewable Energy Transition

Background:
As countries work to reduce carbon emissions, the transition to renewable
energy sources has become increasingly important. This transition involves
complex trade-offs between economic costs, reliability, and environmental
benefits.

The data provided includes historical energy production by source, costs
of different generation technologies, and carbon emissions data.

Q1: Develop a model to predict the optimal mix of energy sources for a
state over the next 20 years, considering cost, reliability, and emissions.

Q2: Analyze how sensitive your model is to changes in technology costs,
policy incentives, and energy demand growth.

Q3: Recommend a phased transition plan that balances economic and
environmental goals. Consider political and social feasibility.

Constraints:
- Maximum 25 pages
- Must include sensitivity analysis
- All assumptions must be justified
- Include at least two visualizations
