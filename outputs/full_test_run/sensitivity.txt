Stability: Moderately Sensitive
Robustness Score: 0.75

Critical Parameters:
- r_0
- socio_economic_factor

Strengths:
- The model effectively captures the influence of baseline growth rate on EV adoption.
- Incorporates key market capacity and battery cost factors, enhancing realism.

Weaknesses:
- Negligible sensitivity to infrastructure and gas price changes, which may be unrealistic.
- Socio-economic factors' influence is underestimated, impacting model accuracy.

Recommendations:
- Incorporate more detailed socio-economic data to better capture their impact on EV adoption.
- Refine the modeling of infrastructure and gas prices to increase sensitivity and realism.
- Enhance the model presentation by providing complete assumptions and detailed mathematical formulations.
- Explore novel data sources and integrate innovative socio-economic factors for richer model insights.
