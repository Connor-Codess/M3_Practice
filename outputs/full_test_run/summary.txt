M3 SOLUTION SUMMARY
==================

FINAL SCORE: 6.7/10

INDIVIDUAL SCORES:
  Accuracy: 5.5
  Clarity: 6.5
  Creativity: 8.0

PROBLEM:
Build a predictive model for EV adoption in one chosen state over 2024-2034, conduct sensitivity analysis to identify key drivers, and propose specific state-level policies with budget and equity considerations

MODEL FRAMEWORK:
Logistic Growth ODE with Socio-Economic Extensions

KEY ASSUMPTIONS (10):
  - Historical EV sales trends from 2014 to 2023 are representative of future sales trends in the chosen state.
  - The decrease in battery costs will continue at a similar rate as observed in the past decade.
  - State-level policy changes are limited to those currently proposed or under serious consideration.
  - EV adoption can be modeled using a logistic growth curve.
  - Charging infrastructure will expand proportionally to the projected growth in EV sales.

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
  Success: False
  Visualizations: 5

SENSITIVITY:
  Stability: Moderately Sensitive
  Robustness: 0.75

ITERATIONS: 1

FINAL FEEDBACK:
The solution demonstrates a robust and innovative approach by incorporating socio-economic factors into a logistic growth model to predict EV adoption. However, a critical syntax error in the code prevents execution and validation of the model, resulting in a low accuracy score. Clarity issues include an incomplete assumptions section and insufficient detail in the mathematical model description. Address these issues by correcting the code error, completing the assumptions, and providing detailed mathematical equations. Creativity is strong, with thoughtful integration of socio-economic factors, but exploring more innovative data sources could enhance insights.
