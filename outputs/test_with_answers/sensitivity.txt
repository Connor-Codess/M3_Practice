Stability: Moderately Sensitive
Robustness Score: 0.70

Critical Parameters:
- growth_rate
- market_saturation

Strengths:
- Moderate robustness to parameter changes indicating some stability.
- Capable of predicting EV adoption trends with moderate sensitivity to key parameters.

Weaknesses:
- Moderate sensitivity indicates potential calibration issues.
- Lack of clarity in mathematical formulations and assumptions can lead to misinterpretations.
- Potential underrepresentation of dynamic interactions between critical variables.

Recommendations:
- Re-calibrate model parameters to better reflect realistic adoption scenarios.
- Include explicit mathematical formulations and clearly state assumptions to improve clarity.
- Incorporate dynamic interactions, such as feedback loops between infrastructure development and adoption rates, to enhance model validity.
