PROBLEM:
Build a predictive model for EV adoption in one chosen state over 10 years, conduct parameter sensitivity analysis to identify key drivers, and develop actionable policy recommendations that balance acceleration goals with budget and equity constraints.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED: 0/3
  Q1: [NOT CAPTURED] Develop a mathematical model to predict EV adoption rates over the next decade f...

MODEL FRAMEWORK:
Dynamic Logistic Growth ODE with Time-Varying Parameters

KEY ASSUMPTIONS (9):
  - The state chosen for analysis will not experience major economic disruptions unrelated to EV adoption over the next 10 years.
  - The data on EV and gasoline vehicle prices, household income, and gasoline and electricity costs will be extrapolated linearly over the next 10 years.
  - Monthly data for EV adoption variables reflects annual trends, assuming no significant seasonal variations.
  - Battery cost reduction follows a consistent technological improvement rate similar to past trends.
  - EV adoption is primarily influenced by purchase price, charging infrastructure, and state incentives.

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
  Success: True
  Visualizations: 6

SENSITIVITY:
  Stability: Moderately Sensitive
  Robustness: 0.70

ITERATIONS: 1

FINAL FEEDBACK:
The submission employs a dynamic logistic growth model that is mathematically robust but lacks explicit answers to the posed questions and policy recommendations. While the creativity is commendable, the clarity and completeness of the response are insufficient. It is crucial to explicitly address all questions, provide clearer sensitivity analysis interpretations, and include necessary policy recommendations. Additionally, enhance clarity by including mathematical formulations and detailed explanations.
